# nvim-sane-substitute ðŸ˜Œ
A substitute of vim's :substitute that uses lua pattern or javascript regex instead of vim regex. Supports ranges and incremental preview.

<!-- vale Microsoft.Adverbs = NO --><!-- vale RedHat.Contractions = NO -->
Since you really don't want to learn a whole new flavor of regex, *just* to be able to make search-and-replace operations in your editor.

> __Note__  
> The plugin is still WIP and not fully usable yet.

## Features
- Use `:SaneSubstitute` or the short form `:S` to do perform search-and-replace
  operations, in lua patterns or javascript regex.
- Supports ranges, if no range is given works on the entire buffer (`%` as range)
- The `g` flag is supported. Without the `g` flag, only the first match in a line is replaced, like `:substitute`.
- Incremental preview of the substitution.
- Support for more flavors is easy to add. [Pull Requests adding more regex flavors are welcome.](#supported-regex-flavors)

```lua
foo -> bar                      -- intended replacement
:%s /foo/bar/                   -- :substitute
:S foo/bar                      -- nvim-sane-substitute

deviceModel2020 -> deviceModel  -- intended replacement
:%s /\(\w\+\)\d\+/\1/g          -- :substitute
:S (%w+)%d+/%1/g                -- nvim-sane-substitute (using lua flavor)
```

## Installation

```lua
-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-sane-substitute",
	config = function() require("sane-substitute").setup({}) end,
}

-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-sane-substitute",
	cmd = {"S", "SaneSubstitute"},
	opts = true,
},
```

## Configuration

```lua
-- default values
opts = {
	regexFlavor = "lua", -- see below for supported flavors
	showNotification = true, -- whether to show the "x replacements made" notification
}
```

Note that any regex flavor other than `"lua"` requires the respective language support to be installed on your machine. `"javascript"`, for instance, requires `node`.

## Supported Regex Flavors

| flavor          | requirements |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `lua` (default) | \-           |
| `javascript`    | `node`       |

__Add Support for more flavors__  
The plugin has been specifically build with easy extensibility in mind. It should take no more than ~10 LoC to add support for more regex flavors. Have a look at [how javascript regex is supported](./lua/sane-substitute/regex/javascript.lua). [There is also a template you should use.](./lua/sane-substitute/regex/template.lua)

## Limitations
- Only the `g` flag is supported.
- Does not support `inccommand=split`. Please use `inccommand=unsplit` instead.
