1. nvim-alt-substitute                    *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute*

A substitute of vim’s ":substitute" Ex-command that uses lua (or glob)
patterns of vim regex. Supports incremental preview and ranges.

Since you really don’t want to learn a whole new flavor of regex, _just_ to
be able to make search-and-replace operations in your editor.

MOTIVATION                     *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-motivation*

Many people like me have only started (neo)vim after the introduction of lua of
configuration language. While pretty much everything about neovim can be done
with lua by now, search-and-replace-operations `:substitute` are one of few
areas remaining where you still have to use vimscript.

Regardless whether you like vimscript or not, learning vim’s flavor of regex
_just_ for search-and-replace-operations feels somewhat unproductive. So why
not work with a regex flavor you are already familiar with? Command of lua
patterns is certainly a more transferrable skill than mastering vim regex.
Also, lua support comes basically for free without dependencies bundled with
neovim already.

While lua patterns are indeed lacking, compared to "real" regex, they do come
with a few quite flexible items like the balanced match `%bxy` or the frontier
pattern `%f[set]` <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1>.


FEATURES                         *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-features*


- Use `:AltSubstitute` or the short form `:S` to do perform search-and-replace
    operations, in lua patterns or javascript regex.
- Incremental preview of the substitution.
- Supports ranges
- The `g` flag is supported and works like with `:substitute`.
- Extensibility: Support for more flavors is easy to add. |alt-substitute-pull-requests-adding-more-regex-flavors-are-welcome.|

>lua
    :%s /\(\w\+\)\d\+/\1/g          -- :substitute
    :S /(%w+)%d+/%1/g               -- nvim-alt-substitute 
    deviceModel2020 -> deviceModel  -- result

INSTALLATION                 *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-installation*

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-alt-substitute",
        cmd = {"S", "AltSubstitute"},
      opts = true,
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-alt-substitute",
        config = function() require("alt-substitute").setup({}) end,
    }
<


CONFIGURATION               *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-configuration*

>lua
    -- default values
    opts = {
        regexFlavor = "lua", -- currently: lua|glob
        showNotification = true, -- whether to show the "x replacements made" notification
    }
<

Note that any regex flavor other than `lua` requires the respective language
support to be installed on your machine. `javascript`, for instance, requires
`node`.


USAGE                               *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-usage*

The `:AltSubstitute` works mostly like `:substitute`. - The `g` flag works the
same way as `:substitute`Without the `g` flag, only the first match in a line
is replaced. With it, every occurrence in a line is replaced. - Ranges are
line-based and work |like all other vim command|. However, as opposed to
`:substitute`, `:AltSubstitute` works on the whole buffer when no range is
given. (In other words, `%` is the default range.) - Like with `:substitute`,
slashes (`/`) delimit search query, replace value, and flags. Therefore, to
search for or replace a `/` you need to escape it with a backslash: `\/`. This
applies even if the regex flavor uses a different character for escaping (like
the `%` in lua).


CURRENT LIMITATIONS   *alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-current-limitations*


- Flags other than `g` flag are not supported.
- `inccommand=split` is not supported, Please use `inccommand=unsplit` instead.
- Line breaks in the search or the replacement value are not supported.


ADD SUPPORT FOR MORE REGEX FLAVORS*alt-substitute-nvim-alt-substitute-add-support-for-more-regex-flavors*

The plugin has been specifically built with extensibility in mind. Adding more
flavors basically requires bridging one search and one replace function.
(Though a certain amount of escaping and performance considerations may be
required.) If you want to add support for more languages, have a look this
plugin’s regex module <./lua/alt-substitute/regex/>, which includes the
implementations for lua and glob patterns.
